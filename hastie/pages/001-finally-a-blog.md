After a few attempts to create a blog without paying or depending on any SaaS. I finally found a nice tool named [Hastie](https://github.com/mkaz/hastie). An incredible tool that can transform any set of markdown files into a static website. Simple to use and can be easily hosted here in github.io.

I highly recommend this tool. (:
